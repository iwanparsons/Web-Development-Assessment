            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p class="aboutBlurb">
                Quadraspire was established in 1995 by Dutch designer Eddie Spruit in an East London Studio and now has its own manufacturing facility in Bath, England where they design and make high performance HiFi racks. 
                Twenty years ago we set out to develop a HiFi rack that would deliver acoustic performance with style. 
                This was achieved by combining solid aluminium columns with specially engineered shelves to create a light and rigid construction that delivers clearer, cleaner musical performance. 
                Since then the Q4 Evo has been sold throughout the world and is still one of our most popular racks.
                <br />
                <br />
                To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Q4 Evo we developed the Bronze upgrade that can be easily retro fitted to any Q4 Evo or SVT Performance rack. 
                All our research into different materials and designs involved extensive listening tests using the tried and tested technique of tuning by ear in the same way as the finest musical instruments are developed. 
                In fact Bronze is one of several high copper content alloys used in the manufacture of some wind and string instruments. 
                The Bronze upgrade has a broader tonal spectrum and greater sustain that opens the soundstage of your system making it more musical and enjoyable without losing detail.
                <br />
                <br />
                To extend the benefits of the Bronze upgrade to all the components in a system we developed the X-Reference. 
                Combining the technology of the SVT rack and the bronze upgrade we effectively created a rack within a rack. 
                Square or rectangular shelves encourage standing waves which can distort the sound of your system. 
                By using a curved design we avoid parallel lines thereby reducing standing waves as well as reducing mass. 
                We extended this principal further to the X-Reference shelf using extreme curves and further reducing mass. 
                It sounds as good as it looks!

                    Eddie Spruit established Quadraspire back in 1995. 
                    His vision was simple, to design and create HiFi furniture that delivers superb acoustic performance with style. 
                    Dutch born, but with roots firmly planted in the UK, Eddie and the team are proud to be putting Great British manufacturing back on the map

                    A self-confessed music lover, Alester has spent over twenty years in the world of HiFi. 
                    After studying product design at Central St Martins, he is the brains behind each new Quadraspire creation. 
                    Alester is passionate about music so system performance is paramount. 
                    Every design and component is listened to before being accepted

                <h2>More notes from R & D</h2>
                <p class="aboutBlurb">
                    It is commonly accepted that every component in a HiFi system from amplifier to source including record decks, cd players and streamers are microphonic and produce resonance that will distort the quality of the music reproduced by a HiFi system. 
                    This distortion can be significantly reduced by siting the HiFi system on a purpose built equipment rack designed to deal with the resonance.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The design of a HiFi rack and the use of materials in its construction is critical. 
                    To develop our HiFi racks we use the tried and tested technique of tuning by ear in the same way as the finest musical instruments are developed. 
                    From extensive research we found that the use of non-ferrous metals such as Aluminium and Bronze along with natural materials such as Wood and Bamboo reduce resonance. 
                    Furthermore the shape of the shelves and columns used within the rack will determine how resonance is treated. 
                    In particular we found that a light but rigid construction delivers a clearer, cleaner musical performance.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Our first HiFi rack - the Q4 - was launched in 1995 and is still one of our most popular HiFi racks throughout the world. 
                    Since its launch we have sought to further improve performance most notably with the introduction of engineered channels in the reverse side of the shelves. 
                    This evolution led to renaming the HiFi rack “Q4EVO”. To mark our 20th anniversary we launched the Bronze upgrade that can be easily retro fitted to the top shelf of any Q4 HiFi rack or wall bracket. 
                    Bronze has a broader tonal spectrum and greater sustain that opens the soundstage of your system making it more musical and enjoyable without losing detail.
